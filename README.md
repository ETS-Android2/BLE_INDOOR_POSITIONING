# indoor-location-monitoring
The project consists in the design and development of an indoor location monitoring application, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The application can be used for asset tracking in places where GPS/GNSS is not available, such as indoor tracking. Various types of Bluetooth beacons are used to test the accuracy between different standards (Bluetooth 4.2 vs 5.0).
